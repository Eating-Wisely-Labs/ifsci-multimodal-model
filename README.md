# IFS Multimodal Model

The IFS Multimodal Model is designed to be a versatile tool for Food Science vision-language tasks, including image understanding, visual reasoning, and conversation. It's specifically designed for the IFS team and community. The model will be release soon.  A powerful multimodal model combining vision and language capabilities, built with LLaVA and LoRA techniques. To combat the OpenAI's limitation, we are building this model for better product precision (calorie, nutrition, etc.) and better customer experience.


## 🌟 Features

- Vision-Language foundation model based on LLaVA architecture
- Efficient fine-tuning using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Multi-task capabilities: image understanding, visual reasoning, and conversation
- Optimized performance with reduced parameter count
- Support for various vision-language tasks

## 🛠️ Requirements

torch>=2.0.0
transformers==4.45.2
accelerate>=0.20.0
peft>=0.3.0

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ifs_multimodal_model.git
cd ifs_multimodal_model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Training

```python
from ifs_model import IFSMultimodalTrainer

trainer = IFSMultimodalTrainer(
    vision_model="clip-vit-large-patch14",
    language_model="vicuna-13b",
    lora_config={
        "r": 8,
        "alpha": 16,
        "dropout": 0.05
    }
)

trainer.train(
    train_data="path/to/training/data",
    eval_data="path/to/eval/data",
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=32
)
```

### Inference

```python
from ifs_model import IFSMultimodalModel

model = IFSMultimodalModel.from_pretrained("path/to/checkpoint")
response = model.generate(
    image="path/to/image.jpg",
    prompt="Describe this image in detail."
)
```
